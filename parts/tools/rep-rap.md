# Rep-Rap style 3D printer

The stage has been designed to be printed on low-cost entry-level fused filament fabrication 3D printers. Many of these printers are Open-Hardware and originate from the [Rep-Rap project](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap).

A popular example is the [Prusa i3 MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/51-original-prusa-i3-mk3s).
